Looking at the login.js file, we notice there is some deobfuscation needed.  After wasting about 20 minutes doing each one individually from top to bottom, I realized where the flag was.

I was getting frustrated making the script find the correct hex values and getting it to only print the flag, so I just grabbed the flag's hex and converted it on its own.

### Usage
Download or copy the script and save as decrypt.py
```
python3 decrypt.py
```
