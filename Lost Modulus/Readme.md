### Download or Copy the lostmodulus.py script

Decrypt is already defined.  Just alter main() to decrypt and decode('utf-8')

**Usage** - 
```
pip install pycryptodome
python3 lostmodulus.py
```
**Notes**  -

This is probably not the intended way given the name.  If it fails, run the script a couple times until the flag shows.  You'll understand once the flag shows.
